# Blefonix RolePlay: MultiSA (Runner)

Unique batch scripts developed specifically for brpsa launcher.

Allows you to have in the same folder incompatible singleplayer, multiplayer and renderhook mods.

The scripts are originally created by [blefony(Trevor_Fair)](https://github.com/blefony).

These scripts use [this library](https://github.com/dbohdan/initool) to work with ini files.

```
@rem example:
initool s $brpsa-settings.ini "" modpack 1 > tempbrp.ini
move /y tempbrp.ini $brpsa-settings.ini >NUL
```

## Installation and Updating

Just put it in the folder where your Blefonix RolePlay is installed. If necessary, confirm the file replacement.

## An Important Reminder

Never install GTA SA (as well as BRPSA) in Program Files. This can bring big problems for the game. Move the folder with the game to another location, and preferably to another disk, for example, to the location: [D:\Games\GTA\BRP SA Full].
